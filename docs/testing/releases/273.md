## Testing Notes and ZIP for testing

**Zip File for testing:**
[woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/files/4932938/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

**Note**: This zip file has 2.7.2 as the version showing in WordPress but it is actually 2.7.3.

This release has minimal impact on StoreAPI. Testing is done to confirm:

- There are no PHP notices related to missing `permission_callback` on `wc/store` REST endpoint requests.
- Existing behaviour of blocks that depend on StoreAPI endpoints work as expected.

## No PHP Notices

Make sure your `wp-config.php` file has `define( 'WP_DEBUG', true )` so that PHP errors/notices are displayed on the site being used to test.

While testing the next section, make sure there are no PHP notices mentioning `permission_callback` for `wc/store` routes showing.

## Smoke test affected blocks

Basically you can smoke test all behaviour for:

* [ ] Reviews block
* [ ] All Products and filter blocks
* [ ] Cart Block
* [ ] Checkout Block

Watch for any console/network errors and unexpected (and unreported) behaviour.
