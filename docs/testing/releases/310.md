Zip file: [woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/files/4994434/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

### Product summary is rendered in All Products

First, let's make sure at least one of the products has a summary:

1. In the admin, go to Products > All Products.
2. Edit any of the products.
3. Scroll down to the Product short description text area.
4. If it's blank, add some text there.
5. In the sidebar, click on Update.

Now, let's make sure the bug is fixed:

1. Create a page and add the All Products block.
2. Click on the pencil icon on the block toolbar to edit it.
3. Below the image add an atomic block: the Product Summary.
4. Verify a text has appeared: <i>Fly your WordPress banner...</i>.
5. Click on Done at the bottom of the block.
6. Click on Publish at the top right of the screen to publish the page.
7. Click on the View Post button to view the post in the frontend side of your store.
8. Verify the product summary block is rendered for products which have it.
