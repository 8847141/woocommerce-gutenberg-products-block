# WooCommerce Store API

The WooCommerce Store API is a public-facing REST API that makes it possible to add items to cart, update the cart, and retrieve cart data in JSON format.

Unlike the main WooCommerce REST API, this API does not require authentication. It is intended to be used via AJAX and other client side code, such as the add-to-cart functionality in blocks, to provide functionality to customers.
